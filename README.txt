IMPORTANT:

This website was made to be implemented on the server instead of locally.

The website server page can be viewed here: www.jh1662.webhosting.canterbury.ac.uk <-- PLEASE VIEW THIS INSTEAD OF LOCALLY!!!

If you try to use it locally, some web pages will not work as intened as the PHP code will not execute.

There are SQL scripts for, incase the client lost the existing server database, creating and populating them again.

The 'Course' page relied entirely on PHP to load, so if you want to view it offline locally then use the 'Courses(OFFLINE).html'.

Also on mobiles for the server website, we removed some images and formatting of the website, and made it simpler, to be more lightweight and fast for the devices with less computer power and screen size!
